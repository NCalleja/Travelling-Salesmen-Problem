/*	WARNING: There's a lot of comments here.
 * 	These comments were meant to help me
 *	as I went through this project. They
 *	explain mostly all the reasoning behind 
 *	the code. It's meant to help me keep
 *	track of everything. This was the first
 *	project that I've ever had of this scale.
 *	I had to learn how to use other classes 
 *	to my advantage, how to use a Interface,
 *	and even how to do graphics. I've never 
 *	made a GUI like this before, there's alot
 *	of work that went into this. Even if 
 *	it looks very sloppy and amatureish, 
 *	just remember this was my first project
 *	that has ever really made me push
 *	myself to the limit, and required this
 *	amount of work and thinking. This is
 *	the most I've ever learned from any
 *	programming project.
