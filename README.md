# Traveling-Salesmen-Problem
This is my attempt to get the best estimate for "The Traveling Salesmen Problem"

- We will be using multiple Algorithms to do the Traveling Salesmen Problem. 
- For each Algorithm we'll keep track of the total amount of tours tested, as well as the runtime.
- Report the Shortest tour and graph it. (For each Algorithm)

Due by October 28th:

- 1.) Read from the File, store locations into an array inside of an array. 					(DONE)
- 2.) Now, store all of the possible distances in an array inside of an array. 					(DONE)
- 3.) Create the Path-Way class to represent a path to be taken, the Path-Way will be a node	(DONE)
- 4.) Create a Class to represent Edges															(DONE)
- 5.) Start with Greedy Algo. to gain an understanding of how this should work					(DONE)
- 6.) Create the Classes,																		(DONE)
    - a.) Uniform Cost 
    - b.) Uniform Cost without crossing Paths
    - c.) Greedy Algorithm
- 7.) Comense Testing (Start with smaller data for Uniform Cost 1 & 2)                          (DONE)
- 8.) Finish Class Assignment Handin:                                                           (DONE)
    - a.) Explain what you learned.
    - b.) Include actual Graphs of the tours
    - c.) Include Tables where we compare the Algorithms

Due by December 9th:

- 9.) Simulated Annealing																		(DONE)
	- a.) Create a new Class for Method Tools to help
- 10.) Genetic Algorithm
- 11.) Finish Class Assignment Handin:
	- a.) Update what you learned
	- b.) Find a way to include a graph of the tours
	- c.) Add Tables to compare the new Algorithms
