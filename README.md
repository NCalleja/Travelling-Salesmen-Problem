# Traveling-Salesmen-Problem
This is my attempt to get the best estimate for "The Traveling Salesmen Problem"

- We will be using multiple Algorithms to do the Traveling Salesmen Problem. 
- For each Algorithm we'll keep track of the total amount of tours tested, as well as the runtime.
- Report the Shortest tour and graph it. (For each Algorithm)

Due by October 28th:

1.) Uniform Cost
2.) Uniform Cost except without crossing paths
3.) Greedy Algorithm (Choosing the Shortest Paths)

Things to Do:

1.) Setup a System where The User gets to choose which Algorithm they'd like to use.
2.) Create the skeleton of those Algorithms
3.) Be able to read from the file and put it into a 3D Matrix to compute.
4.) Create the Methods,
    a.) Uniform Cost 
    b.) Uniform Cost without crossing Paths
    c.) Greedy Algorithm
5.) Comense Testing (Start with smaller data for Uniform Cost 1 & 2)
6.) Finish Class Assignment Handin:
    a.) Explain what you learned.
    b.) Include actual Graphs of the tours
    c.) Include Tables where we compare the Algorithms

Due by December 2nd:

4.) Genetic Algorithm
5.) Simulated Annealing
