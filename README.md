# Traveling-Salesmen-Problem
This is my attempt to get the best estimate for "The Traveling Salesmen Problem"

- We will be using multiple Algorithms to do the Traveling Salesmen Problem. 
- For each Algorithm we'll keep track of the total amount of tours tested, as well as the runtime.
- Report the Shortest tour and graph it. (For each Algorithm)

Due by October 28th:

- 1.) Uniform Cost
- 2.) Uniform Cost except without crossing paths
- 3.) Greedy Algorithm (Choosing the Shortest Paths)

Things to Do:

- 1.) Setup a System where The User gets to choose which Algorithm they'd like to use. 	(DONE)
- 2.) Create the skeleton of those Algorithms						(DONE)
- 3.) Be able to read from the file and put it into a 3D Matrix to compute.		(DONE)
- 3.5) Create a Method to calculate Distance
- 4.) Create the Methods,
    - a.) Uniform Cost 
    - b.) Uniform Cost without crossing Paths
    - c.) Greedy Algorithm
- 5.) Comense Testing (Start with smaller data for Uniform Cost 1 & 2)
- 6.) Finish Class Assignment Handin:
    - a.) Explain what you learned.
    - b.) Include actual Graphs of the tours
    - c.) Include Tables where we compare the Algorithms

Due by December 2nd:

- 4.) Genetic Algorithm
- 5.) Simulated Annealing
